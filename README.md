# Express Socket.io Wrapper
#### ESWrapper for short

ESWrapper will:

* "wrap" express.js with socket.io. Socket.io client can make http-like requests and wrapper will map them to express.js corresponding route functions.
* get `request` events, emulate http request for express.js routes and send http response to a client as `response` event.
* let you is for moving to sockets from http only express.js(or express.js-like) servers.
* make it super easy to setup and start using socket.io from the box without creating tons of events and event-handlers.
